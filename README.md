## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Strenghthen my CSS and html skills.


### Continued development

This was a very challenging project as making the details of each external page takes a lot of time and detail orientation, I would say adding full functionality from making the booking form functional with Firebase to creating more pages whem the buttons are clicked, also add a Login feature with Liked sections included.
